earthquake-latest-earthquakes
==============

Mobile friendly, interactive earthquake map and list application.

### Getting Started:
Make sure you are in your `earthquake-latest-earthquakes` project directory.

1. Install NPM dependencies

		`npm install`

1. Install Bower dependencies

		`bower install`

1. Preview in a browser

		`grunt`

		On windows, `gateway` has trouble resolving default documents and you need
		to change the opened url to `http://localhost:8000/index.html` in order to
		view the Test Suite.
		To view the application go to 'http://localhost:8080/index.html'

### Having trouble getting started?

1. If this is your first time using **grunt**, you need to install the grunt
command line interface globally

		`npm install -g grunt-cli`

1. If this is your first time using **bower**, you need to install bower globally

		`npm install -g bower`
